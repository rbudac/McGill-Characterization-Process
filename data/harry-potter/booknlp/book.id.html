Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. Her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) Pepperup potion worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley, who had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. The steam pouring from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) vivid hair gave the impression that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) whole head was on fire.

<p/>Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid's pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver Wood's enthusiasm for regular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why Harry was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before Halloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the skin and splattered with mud.

<p/>Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn't been a happy practice session. Fred and George, who had been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. They reported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs, shooting through the air like missiles.

<p/>As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering under his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) breath, <div class="bookquote">''... don't fulfill their requirements ... half an inch, if that ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gryffindor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello, Nick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gryffindor</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello, hello,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick</b></font>)</div>said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) wore a dashing, plumed hat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which concealed the fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) neck was almost completely severed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to the dark sky and torrential rain outside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look troubled, young Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick</b></font>)</div>said Nick, folding a transparent letter as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) spoke and tucking it inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) doublet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So do you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick</b></font>)</div>Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, <div class="bookquote">``a matter of no importance... It's not as though I really wanted to join... Thought I'd apply, but apparently I `don't fulfill requirements' -''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nick</b></font>)</div><p/>In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you would think, wouldn't you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) erupted suddenly, pulling the letter back out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) pocket, <div class="bookquote">``that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh - yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, who was obviously supposed to agree.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean, and my head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule. However -''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick</b></font>)</div>Nearly Headless Nick shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) letter open and read furiously: <div class="bookquote">''`We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies. You will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as Horseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret, therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements. With very best wishes, Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nick</b></font>)</div><p/>Fuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! Most people would think that's good and beheaded, but oh, no, it's not enough for Sir Properly Decapitated-Podmore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nick</b></font>)</div><p/>Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a far calmer tone, <div class="bookquote">``So - what's bothering you? Anything I can do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Not unless you know where we can get seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly -''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>The rest of Harry's sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling from somewhere near his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ankles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Norris, the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker, Argus Filch, as a sort of deputy in his (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) endless battle against students.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better get out of here, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick</b></font>)</div>said Nick quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Filch isn't in a good mood - he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s been cleaning all morning, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sees you dripping mud all over the place -''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. Norris, but not quickly enough. Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) foul cat, Argus Filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to Harry's right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule-breaker. There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nose was unusually purple.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Filth!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shouted, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jowls aquiver, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes popping alarmingly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry's Quidditch robes. <div class="bookquote">``Mess and muck everywhere! I've had enough of it, I tell you! Follow me, Potter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>So Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and followed Filch back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor.

<p/>Harry had never been inside Filch's office before; it was a place most students avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place. Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls; from their labels, Harry could see that they contained details of every pupil Filch had ever punished. Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves. A highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind Filch's desk. It was common knowledge that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was always begging Dumbledore to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling.

<p/>Filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) desk and began shuffling around looking for parchment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dung,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) muttered furiously, <div class="bookquote">``great sizzling dragon bogies ... frog brains ... rat intestines ... I've had enough of it ... make an example ... where's the form ... yes ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) retrieved a large roll of parchment from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) desk drawer and stretched it out in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), dipping his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) long black quill into the ink pot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Name ... Harry Potter. Crime ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was only a bit of mud!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it's an extra hour scrubbing!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shouted Filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bulbous nose. <div class="bookquote">``Crime ... befouling the castle ... suggested sentence ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Dabbing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) streaming nose, Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry who waited with bated breath for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sentence to fall.

<p/>But as Filch lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) quill, there was a great BANG! on the ceiling of the office, which made the oil lamp rattle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``PEEVES!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Filch roared, flinging down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) quill in a transport of rage. <div class="bookquote">``I'll have you this time, I'll have you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>And without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed from the office, Mrs. Norris streaking alongside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/>Peeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and distress. Harry didn't much like Peeves, but couldn't help feeling grateful for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) timing. Hopefully, whatever Peeves had done -LRB-and it sounded as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d wrecked something very big this time-RRB- would distract Filch from Harry.

<p/>Thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) should probably wait for Filch to come back, Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. There was only one thing on it apart from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with silver lettering on the front. With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn't on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read: kwikspell A Correspondence Course in Beginners' Magic

<p/>Intrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside. More curly silver writing on the front page said: Feel out of step in the world of modern magic? Find yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells? Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork? There is an answer! Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-learn course. Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell method! Madam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes: <div class="bookquote">``I had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspell course, I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my Scintillation Solution!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Z. Nettles</b></font>)</div>Warlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says: <div class="bookquote">``My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) into a yak! Thank you, Kwikspell!''

 (<font color='red'><b>J.</b></font>)</div><p/>Fascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope's contents. Why on earth did Filch want a Kwikspell course? Did this mean he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wasn't a proper wizard? Harry was just reading <div class="bookquote">``Lesson One: Holding Your Wand -LRB-Some Useful Tips-RRB-''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>when shuffling footsteps outside told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Filch was coming back. Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened.

<p/>Filch was looking triumphant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was saying gleefully to Mrs. Norris. <div class="bookquote">``We'll have Peeves out this time, my sweet -''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which, Harry realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had started.

<p/>Filch's pasty face went brick red. Harry braced himself for a tidal wave of fury. Filch hobbled across to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it into a drawer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you - did you read -?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sputtered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry lied quickly.

<p/>Filch's knobbly hands were twisting together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I thought you'd read my private - not that it's mine - for a friend - be that as it may - however -''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry was staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), alarmed; Filch had never looked madder. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes were popping, a tic was going in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pouchy cheeks, and the tartan scarf didn't help.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well - go - and don't breathe a word - not that - however, if you didn't read - go now, I have to write up Peeves' report - go -''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Amazed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) luck, Harry sped out of the office, up the corridor, and back upstairs. To escape from Filch's office without punishment was probably some kind of school record.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry! Harry! Did it work?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nick</b></font>)</div><p/>Nearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom. Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>), Harry could see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch's office,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick</b></font>)</div>said Nick eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``Thought it might distract him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) -''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was that you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry gratefully. <div class="bookquote">``Yeah, it worked, I didn't even get detention. Thanks, Nick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless Nick, Harry noticed, was still holding Sir Patrick's rejection letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said.

<p/>Nearly Headless Nick stopped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tracks and Harry walked right through him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hadn't; it was like stepping through an icy shower.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But there is something you could do for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick</b></font>)</div>said Nick excitedly. <div class="bookquote">``Harry - would I be asking too much - but no, you wouldn't want -''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick</b></font>)</div>said Nearly Headless Nick, drawing himself up and looking dignified.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, not sure whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) should look sorry or happy about this. <div class="bookquote">``Right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends will be coming from all over the country. It would be such an honor if you would attend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most welcome, too, of course - but I daresay you'd rather go to the school feast?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) watched Harry on tenterhooks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry quickly, <div class="bookquote">``I'll come -''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear boy! Harry Potter, at my deathday party! And''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>- he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hesitated, looking excited - <div class="bookquote">``do you think you could possibly mention to Sir Patrick how very frightening and impressive you find me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of - of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/>Nearly Headless Nick beamed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``A deathday party?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione</b></font>)</div>said Hermione keenly when Harry had changed at last and joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) and Ron in the common room. <div class="bookquote">``I bet there aren't many living people who can say they've been to one of those - it'll be fascinating!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, who was halfway through his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Potions homework and grumpy. <div class="bookquote">``Sounds dead depressing to me...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Rain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but inside all looked bright and cheerful. The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander. Fred had <div class="bookquote">``rescued''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred</b></font>)</div>the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people.

<p/>Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room. The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander's mouth, and its escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from Harry's mind. By the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats, Hagrid's vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A promise is a promise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione</b></font>)</div>Hermione reminded Harry bossily. <div class="bookquote">``You said you'd go to the deathday party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>So at seven o'clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons.

<p/>The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick's party had been lined with candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long, thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step they took. As Harry shivered and drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes tightly around him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that supposed to be music?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron whispered. They turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) said mournfully. <div class="bookquote">``Welcome, welcome ... so pleased you could come...''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) swept off his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) plumed hat and bowed them inside.

<p/>It was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles. Their breath rose in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we have a look around?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry suggested, wanting to warm up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Careful not to walk through anyone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron nervously, and they set off around the edge of the dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) forehead. Harry wasn't surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, stopping abruptly. <div class="bookquote">``Turn back, turn back, I don't want to talk to Moaning Myrtle -''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry as they backtracked quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Myrtle</b></font>) haunts one of the toilets in the girls' bathroom on the first floor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Myrtle</b></font>) haunts a toilet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. It's been out-of-order all year because she (<font color='blue'><b>Myrtle</b></font>) keeps having tantrums and flooding the place. I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it's awful trying to have a pee with her (<font color='blue'><b>Myrtle</b></font>) wailing at you -''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look, food!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron.

<p/>On the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in black velvet. They approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks, horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large, rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington died 31st October, 1492

<p/>Harry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched low, and walked through it, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you taste it if you walk though it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Almost,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ghost</b></font>)</div>said the ghost sadly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) drifted away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect they've let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione</b></font>)</div>said Hermione knowledgeably, pinching her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can we move? I feel sick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron.

<p/>They had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello, Peeves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry cautiously.

<p/>Unlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was wearing a bright orange party hat, a revolving bow tie, and a broad grin on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wide, wicked face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nibbles?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said sweetly, offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heard you talking about poor Myrtle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peeves</b></font>)</div>said Peeves, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes dancing. <div class="bookquote">``Rude you was about poor Myrtle.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took a deep breath and bellowed, <div class="bookquote">``OY! MYRTLE!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, Peeves, don't tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Myrtle</b></font>) what I said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Myrtle</b></font>)'ll be really upset,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered frantically. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean it, I don't mind her (<font color='blue'><b>Myrtle</b></font>) - er, hello, Myrtle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The ghost</b></font>)</div><p/>The squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had the glummest face Harry had ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said sulkily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you, Myrtle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in a falsely bright voice. <div class="bookquote">``It's nice to see you out of the toilet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Myrtle</b></font>)</div><p/>Myrtle sniffed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Granger was just talking about you -''  (<font color='red'><b>Myrtle</b></font>)</div>said Peeves slyly in Myrtle's ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just saying - saying - how nice you look tonight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, glaring at Peeves.

<p/>Myrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're making fun of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Myrtle</b></font>) said, silver tears welling rapidly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Myrtle</b></font>) small, see-through eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No - honestly - didn't I just say how nice Myrtle's looking?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yeah -''

 (<font color='red'><b>Myrtle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Myrtle</b></font>) did -''

 (<font color='red'><b>Myrtle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't lie to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Myrtle</b></font>)</div>Myrtle gasped, tears now flooding down her (<font color='blue'><b>Myrtle</b></font>) face, while Peeves chuckled happily over her (<font color='blue'><b>Myrtle</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``D'you think I don't know what people call me behind my back? Fat Myrtle! Ugly Myrtle! Miserable, moaning, moping Myrtle!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've forgotten pimply,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Peeves hissed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Myrtle</b></font>) ear.

<p/>Moaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon. Peeves shot after her (<font color='blue'><b>Myrtle</b></font>), pelting her (<font color='blue'><b>Myrtle</b></font>) with moldy peanuts, yelling, <div class="bookquote">``Pimply! Pimply!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione</b></font>)</div>said Hermione sadly.

<p/>Nearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them through the crowd.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Enjoying yourselves?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they lied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bad turnout,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick</b></font>)</div>said Nearly Headless Nick proudly. <div class="bookquote">``The Wailing Widow came all the way up from Kent... It's nearly time for my speech, I'd better go and warn the orchestra...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very moment. They, and everyone else in the dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as a hunting horn sounded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, here we go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick</b></font>)</div>said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly.

<p/>Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by a headless horseman. The assembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too, but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick's face.

<p/>The horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted, rearing and plunging. At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) bearded head under his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) arm, from which position he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) was blowing the horn. The ghost leapt down, lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) head high in the air so he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) could see over the crowd -LRB-everyone laughed-RRB-, and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick, squashing his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) head back onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nick!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) roared. <div class="bookquote">``How are you? Head still hanging in there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Nick on the shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Welcome, Patrick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick</b></font>)</div>said Nick stiffly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Live `uns!''  (<font color='red'><b>Patrick</b></font>)</div>said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and Hermione and giving a huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) head fell off again -LRB-the crowd howled with laughter-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very amusing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick</b></font>)</div>said Nearly Headless Nick darkly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't mind Nick!''  (<font color='red'><b>Patrick</b></font>)</div>shouted Sir Patrick's head from the floor. <div class="bookquote">``Still upset we won't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) join the Hunt! But I mean to say - look at the fellow -''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Nick, <div class="bookquote">``Nick's very - frightening and - er -''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nick</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick</b></font>)</div>yelled Sir Patrick's head. <div class="bookquote">``Bet he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) asked you to say that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I could have everyone's attention, it's time for my speech!''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick</b></font>)</div>said Nearly Headless Nick loudly, striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div><p/>But nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and the rest of the Headless Hunt had just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to watch. Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) audience, but gave up as Sir Patrick's head went sailing past him (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) to loud cheers.

<p/>Harry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't stand much more of this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron muttered, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) teeth chattering, as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry agreed.

<p/>They backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them, and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pudding might not be finished yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron hopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall.

<p/>And then Harry heard it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''... rip ... tear ... kill ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had heard in Lockhart's office.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might, looking around, squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, what're you -?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's that voice again - shut up a minute -''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''... soo hungry ... for so long ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione froze, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">''... kill ... time to kill ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure it was moving away - moving upward. A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stared at the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a phantom, to whom stone ceilings didn't matter?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This way,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shouted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) began to run, up the stairs, into the entrance hall. It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall. Harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, what're we -''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``SHH!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry strained his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears. Distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainter still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard the voice: <div class="bookquote">''... I smell blood... I SMELL BLOOD!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach lurched -

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's going to kill someone!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shouted, and ignoring Ron's and Hermione's bewildered faces, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) own pounding footsteps -

<p/>Harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and Hermione panting behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), not stopping until they turned a corner into the last, deserted passage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, what was that all about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, wiping sweat off his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't hear anything...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione</b></font>)</div><p/>But Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Something was shining on the wall ahead. They approached slowly, squinting through the darkness. Foot-high words had been daubed on the wall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches. the chamber of secrets has been opened. enemies of the heir, beware.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that thing - hanging underneath?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, a slight quiver in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) voice.

<p/>As they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped - there was a large puddle of water on the floor; Ron and Hermione grabbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), and they inched toward the message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. All three of them realized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash.

<p/>Mrs. Norris, the caretaker's cat, was hanging by her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) tail from the torch bracket. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was stiff as a board, her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) eyes wide and staring.

<p/>For a few seconds, they didn't move. Then Ron said, <div class="bookquote">``Let's get out of here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shouldn't we try and help -''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry began awkwardly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Trust me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``We don't want to be found here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told them that the feast had just ended. From either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the passage from both ends.

<p/>The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight.

<p/>Then someone shouted through the quiet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Enemies of the Heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was Draco Malfoy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) had pushed to the front of the crowd, his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) cold eyes alive, his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) usually bloodless face flushed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) grinned at the sight of the hanging, immobile cat.
